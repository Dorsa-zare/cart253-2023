Project 1

"Save the Environment" is a fun simulation game designed to show you just how easy it is to make a positive impact on our planet. With user-friendly controls and interactive challenges, you'll learn and practice simple actions that help preserve our environment. The game features original graphics and images created by myself, adding a personal touch to your journey of making the world a better place, one step at a time.
In the game, you'll be tasked with various environmental challenges, such as cleaning up trash from a beach or planting trees in a garden. By clicking, dragging, and releasing, you can easily pick up trash or plant trees. Your contribution to a cleaner and greener environment is celebrated at the end of each challenge. The game is designed to be both enjoyable and educational, teaching you how small actions can have a big impact.
