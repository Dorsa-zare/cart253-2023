Artistâ€™s Statement: Emotional Support Pet

Emotional Support Pet is my digital creation crafted to  offer comfort during challenging moments, specifically tailored for fellow university students navigating a spectrum of emotions. This game provides a calm space for reflection and emotional relief without the need for spoken words.

The game addresses common emotional states like anxiety, feeling down, and anger. It suggests uncomplicated games that resonate with the user's emotional state, providing a gentle means of coping.

For instance, in the Anxiety Game, users can pop bubbles accompanied by calming visuals and soothing bubble sounds. The Discouraged Game features a positive affirmation journal, encouraging users to speak uplifting words to themselves. The Angry Game offers a creative outlet for releasing tension through a calming wall painting experience.

The user's experience is at the forefront of the design. Users can choose the appearance of their virtual companion, with all illustrations and visual designs personally crafted by me. The color palette and patterns are thoughtfully selected to evoke positive emotions and create a visually engaging experience.

From a technical perspective, I experimented with various functionalities. Speech recognition was explored to allow users to speak affirmations, fostering a more immersive and personal experience. Dynamic movement of game elements replaces static images, enhancing engagement and creating a more lively atmosphere.

Emotional Support Pet is my way of employing technology and art to support emotional well-being. It's a simple intervention, urging users to face their feelings, accept themselves, and hopefully, feel a bit better.
